# React Practice Projects 🚀

A collection of React practice projects built to strengthen core concepts, explore hooks, and gain hands-on experience with real-world UI logic.
This repository is focused on **learning by building** — each project targets specific React concepts and patterns rather than just visual output.

---
📌 Purpose of This Repository
- Practice React fundamentals and modern React features
- Improve problem-solving and component-based thinking
- Understand state, props, hooks, and UI logic deeply
- Build confidence by implementing ideas from scratch

📂 Project Structure
Each project lives in its own folder:
react-practice-projects/
│
├── project-1-name/
│ ├── src/
│ ├── public/
│ └── README.md (optional project-specific notes)
│
├── project-2-name/
